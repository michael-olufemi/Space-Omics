# ðŸ§¬ Space Omics Hackathon â€“ Bioinformatics Scripts

This repository contains scripts and workflows developed during the **ESA Space Omics Hackathon**, where our team designed a bioinformatics pipeline to support spaceflight-related multi-omics data analysis.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The scripts in this repository focus on automating and streamlining core analyses in a space biology context, with an emphasis on:

- RNA-Seq processing
- Epigenomics (methylation analysis)
- Gene expression quantification
- Workflow automation via shell scripts and R
